        essay_part1 = """Data Privacy is a process of handling individual personal information and ensuring that personal data is collected and protected. It is crucial in building trust between organizations and individuals, especially in our digital world. There are many advantages and disadvantages to data privacy. The advantages include building trust and confidence, enhancing security, improving data quality, and gaining a competitive advantage. However, disadvantages include reduced data availability and the complexity in implementation, which can require significant expertise and lead to confusion about compliance obligations.

        Cyber Awareness is key to understanding and acknowledging online safety practices and the potential risks associated with digital technologies. Cyber criminals are individuals or groups engaging in illegal activities using computers, networks, or the internet, often for financial gain or data theft. They use techniques such as hacking, phishing, ransomware attacks, and denial-of-service attacks.

        Cyber criminals can face various punishments, including:
        - **Fines:** Monetary penalties imposed on guilty parties.
        - **Prison Sentences:** Lengthy incarceration for serious offenses.
        - **Probation:** Compliance with specific conditions post-sentence.
        - **Restitution:** Compensation to victims for financial losses.
        - **Community Service:** Sentences requiring community involvement.

        **DATA PRIVACY ACT**
        In the Philippines, the primary law is the Data Privacy Act of 2012 (Republic Act No. 10173), which protects individual personal information. Key aspects include:
        1. **Purpose:** Protects personal information in both sectors.
        2. **Key Provisions:** Establishes rights for data subjects and obligations for controllers.
        3. **Consent:** Data collection and processing require consent.
        4. **Rights of Data Subjects:** Access, correction, and deletion of data are granted.

        The National Privacy Commission (NPC) monitors compliance, enforces the law, and promotes awareness about data privacy rights. Compliance with these regulations is essential for organizations managing personal information."""
