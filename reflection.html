    <h1> Data Privacy and Cyber Awareness</h1>
    <p>
        Data Privacy is a process of handling individual Personal  information<br>
         and ensuring that personal data is collected and protected and<br>
         it is  a crucial in building trust between organization and individuals especially in our digital world<br>
         in this organization has many advantage and disadvantage of Data Privacy.<br>
         when it comes to advantages of data privacy we can say  that <br>
         building trust and confidence between organization and individuals, enhance security,<br>
         improve data quality and competitive advantage.<br>
         but of course we also have disadvantages the disadvantages we have are <br>
         Reduced Data Availability meaning that the privacy measure can restrict access to valuable data<br>
         that  could be used for analytics,marketing.<br>
         we have so many disadvantages but i'll only two example and the last one my example is<br>
         the Complexity in Implementation meaning it's navigating the legal landscape of data privacy can be complicated,<br>
         requiring significant expertise and often leading to confusion about compliance obligations.<br>

<h3> DATA PRIVACY ACT</h3>
